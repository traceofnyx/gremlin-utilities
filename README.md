# Gremlin Utilities

**Tools forged in chaos, curiosity, and caffeine.**

Welcome to the unhinged toolbox of a binary-bending, Python-wielding, chaos-fueled gremlin in training. These aren't just scripts—they're tiny rebellions wrapped in logic and occasional sass.

Whether you're decoding a secret message, turning text into binary, or just showing Python who's boss, this is the vault where the magic brews.

## What’s Inside

### `binary_tool.py`
A dual-mode (text → binary / binary → text) translator that:
- Accepts user input like a polite daemon
- Decodes or encodes in perfect 8-bit fashion
- Logs every input/output like it’s watching the Matrix
- Refuses to break unless you *really* try

## Coming Soon
File input/output

Encrypted logs?

Reverse-gremlin mode: find hidden patterns in binary

More tools. More chaos. More flair.

## License
No license. Just don't be evil. Or do. But if you do, at least write readable code.
